## Karo

- Karo is a learning simulation of machine learning cars moving around and starting to learn as the move.



## Why? and how will it help?
###### Tesla's Automatic cars that is trained with particular images which means that they are unable to understand by itself. 

###### In this situation the car is learning by its mistakes.

This type of learning is much more efficient than the earlier cars.
These can be included in the real life cars. The car can be trained with static images and then after that, this could be used to learn and catch up with that training data. 


## What is used to create this?
In this simulation it is made with python with the help of a module called `neat-python`

## How to run this?
- Clone this repository

`git clone`

- After that open this folder in a terminal.

`cd karo-python`

- Install dependencies

`pip install pygame neat-python`

- Run the main.py file

`python main.py`
