## Karo

- Karo is a learning simulation of machine learning cars moving around and starting to learn as the move.



## Gap or Problem?
###### An Automatic car is trained with particular images i.e. 10000 images altogether taken with 2 or 3 cameras attached to the front, middle and rear, which means that they are unable to understand from its mistakes because it has no form of learning by itself.

###### Karo is learning by its mistakes.

## Need
In today's world its heavily required that the Machine Learning Model should learn from its mistakes like we humans do...
This type of learning is much more efficient than the earlier cars.

## Solution
Karo is a simulation software / program, Which shows that cars can be more efficient if it learns by itself for example, if automated car crashes then we need to re-train the model so its not efficient as it takes time, effort and money but in Karo, the car is learning by itself if it crashes as we are using a more qualified version of Artificial Itelligence.

## Impact
So the it will avoid accidents and will be more smooth journey. It will also take less time.

## What is used to create this?
In this simulation it is made with python with the help of a module called `neat-python`

## How to run this?
- Clone this repository

`git clone https://github.com/PRATYUSH-ROY/karo-python`

- After that open this folder in a terminal

`cd karo-python`

- Install dependencies

`pip install pygame neat-python scipy`


- Run the main.py file

`python main.py`
