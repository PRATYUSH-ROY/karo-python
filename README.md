## Karo

- Karo is a learning simulation of machine learning cars moving around and starting to learn as the move.



## Gap or Problem?
###### Automatic cars is trained with particular images which means that they are unable to understand by its mistakes. 

###### In this situation the car is learning by its mistakes.

## Need
In today's world its heavily required that the Machine Learning Model Should learn by its mistakes like we humans do...
This type of learning is much more efficient than the earlier cars.

## Solution
Karo is a simulation software / program, Which shows that cars can be much efficient if it learns by itself. A real-life car can be trained with static images and then, this method could be used to learn and catch up with that training data.

## What is used to create this?
In this simulation it is made with python with the help of a module called `neat-python`

## How to run this?
- Clone this repository

`git clone https://github.com/PRATYUSH-ROY/karo-python`

- After that open this folder in a terminal

`cd karo-python`

- Install dependencies

`pip install pygame neat-python scipy`


- Run the main.py file

`python main.py`
